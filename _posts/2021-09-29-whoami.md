**Name:** Dylan Hyoung Seung Lee

**Born in:** February 5th, 1998

**Graduated University of Melbourne in 2019 December**

**Majored in:** Computing and Software Systems

**Also studied:** Some engineering mechanics ( worst choice ever :( )

**Interested in:** Playing basketball. Was a DJ at one point, but ear damaging was intolerable (I am 99 percent sure something in my ears went wrong during that time)

​	Until 2017, I had no idea what it feels like to major in *computing and software systems*. I graduated high school with IB diploma in 2016 and had a year break to do some part-time jobs to gain experience in society. 2016 was also the year I went crazy with electric guitars. Composed few metal songs, and did some casual gigs. 

​	From 2017, I started my life in Melbourne, Australia. University of Melbourne was definitely very challenging to graduate doing computing and engineering subjects. Everyday was full of workloads and it got really intense in my graduating year. But hey, I survived!! HAHA.

​	After graduation, I went to do military service in South Korea. Got discharged in 2021-08-27, I am trying to get back in touch with my programming career.

​	Languages I can handle are as follows:

1. **Python**
2. **C**
3. **Java**
4. **Haskell & Prolog (I prefer haskell than prolog 100%)**
5. **SQL Workbench**
6. **Anything you want me to learn :)**
