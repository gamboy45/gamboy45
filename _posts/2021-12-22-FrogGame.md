# Structure

This project implements object oriented programming. This is called project 2 because the first project consisted students to make a basic implementation of this game. So, this 'Frog Game' project is the finished version of project 1 done previously.

Talking about the structure, sprite class encapsulates every object that can be present on the map. 

Objects are as follows:

​	-Frog (Player, lives, extralife)![frog](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/frog-16401722487211.png) ![lives](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/lives.png) ![extralife](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/extralife.png)

​	-Hazard (bike, bulldozer, bus, racecar)![bike](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/bike.png) ![bulldozer](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/bulldozer.png) ![bus](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/bus.png) ![racecar](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/racecar.png) 

​	-Stepping materials (log, long log, turtle) ![log](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/log.png) ![longlog](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/longlog.png) ![turtles](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/turtles.png)

​	-Map consisting material (grass, water)![grass](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/grass.png) ![water](../images/2021-12-22-FrogGame/water.png)

When the game starts, these objects are rightfully called by the World.java.
