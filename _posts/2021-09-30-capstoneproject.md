# Abstract

â€‹	Team composed of Hanze, Alexander, Robert and Dylan, we aimed to solve our client's inconvenience. Client had a problem with sorting artifacts in his house. Artifacts are such as letters and postcards that his families used to send and dates start from  early 1900s. Because old artifacts were damaged and hard to maintain, he requested us to create a web-platform to store his artifacts (taking pictures and uploading it). Main goals that we had to achieve were as follows; a fully working family tree, upload and delete system, and an expandable database system.
