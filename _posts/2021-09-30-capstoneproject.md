# Abstract

​	Team composed of Hanze, Alexander, Robert and Dylan, Team H.A.R.D Core, we aimed to solve our client's inconvenience. Client had a problem with sorting artifacts in his house. Artifacts are such as letters and postcards that his families used to send and dates start from  early 1900s. Because old artifacts were damaged and hard to maintain, he requested us to create a web-platform to store his artifacts (taking pictures and uploading it). Main goals that we had to achieve were as follows; a fully working family tree, upload and delete system, and an expandable database system.

# Client

**Job:** Head Professor of I.T Project in University of Melbourne

**Request:** Need a Web-Platform that can store artifacts

**Main features needed:** Family Tree, Upload & Delete system, Image file support, Timeline

Yes, we had the head professor as our client. Capstone project was meant to have parents or close people around as a client. However, as the team was comprised of foreign students, we decided to have Leon Sterling as our client. He kindly accepted us and two other teams. In the end, three teams experienced the  capstone project very different from other graduating students. 







# Planning Process

​	Strictly following the procedure of Project Management, the team had weekly meetings, 4 sprints with an assigned advisor, and the final presentation. 

Below documentations are Team H.A.R.D Core's planning.

# Team H.A.R.D Core's Outcome

​	4 people had individual roles to perform, Hanze on CSS, Robert on Frontend, Alex on presentation and myself on backend. This project definitely gave me a very hard time.

### Backend

​	With the client wanting to have three teams work on the backend together, fluent communication between three backend developers were necessary. While working on the backend, I had to attend three meetings per week, one for sprint, another for the team, and the last for backend developers. Because three brains were working, different opinions caused troubles. From backend platform to the design, coming to an agreement took a considerable amount of time. 

​	First agreement was made to use Amazon S3 for the backend because of its easiness with deployment. However, the client rejected that proposal and insisted on using SQL Workbench for database. Thus, backend developers remodelled database to suit the client's request.

​	Following table design was used by Team H.A.R.D Core. Two other teams had few variations as they focused on different funtionalities, but teams worked with same base model for later deployment. Our team primarily focused on simplicity, extensibility, and robustness. 

​	After finishing up modelling, my main job was finished. When Robert and Hanze were working on Frontend, I was processing enormous amount of data collected from the client's house. This process included me having to travel to the client's house to take pictures of artifacts, learning about the deployment environment, and having a cup of tea.
