# Abstract

​	Team composed of Hanze, Alexander, Robert and Dylan, Team H.A.R.D Core, we aimed to solve our client's inconvenience. Client had a problem with sorting artifacts in his house. Artifacts are such as letters and postcards that his families used to send and dates start from  early 1900s. Because old artifacts were damaged and hard to maintain, he requested us to create a web-platform to store his artifacts (taking pictures and uploading it). Main goals that we had to achieve were as follows; a fully working family tree, upload and delete system, and an expandable database system.

# Client

**Job:** Head Professor of I.T Project in University of Melbourne

**Request:** Need a Web-Platform that can store artifacts

**Main features needed:** Family Tree, Upload & Delete system, Image file support, Timeline

Yes, we had the head professor as our client. Capstone project was meant to have parents or close people around as a client. However, as the team was comprised of foreign students, we decided to have Leon Sterling as our client. He kindly accepted us and two other teams. In the end, three teams experienced the  capstone project very different from other graduating students. 







# Team H.A.R.D Core's Outcome

​	4 people had individual roles to perform, Hanze on CSS, Robert on Frontend, Alex on presentation and myself on backend. This project definitely gave me a very hard time.

### Backend

​	With the client wanting to have three teams work on the backend together, fluent communication between three backend developers were necessary. While working on the backend, I had to attend three meetings per week, one for sprint, another for the team, and the last for backend developers. Because three brains were working, different opinions caused troubles. From backend platform to the design, coming to an agreement took a considerable amount of time. 

​	First agreement was made to use Amazon S3 for the backend because of its easiness with deployment. However, the client rejected that proposal and insisted on using SQL Workbench for database. Thus, backend developers remodelled database to suit the client's request. Picture below is the confirmed version of database model.
